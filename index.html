The project utilizes data from the Wyscout platform, which provides detailed data on player actions during matches. The project includes several steps, starting with data collection and preprocessing, followed by feature engineering and model training. The models used in this project include a player embedding model and a player performance model.
<br>
The main objective of this project is to provide insights into a player's skills and performance over time. The project includes several visualizations, such as skills radar charts, actions heatmaps, xG evaluations, and player embeddings. The project also provides recommendations for similar players based on player embeddings.
<br>
The project is built using Python and libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit. The code is organized into several modules, including data.py, features.py, models.py, and plot.py. The project also includes a user interface built using the Streamlit library, which allows users to explore player performance and skills data interactively.
